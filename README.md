Night city generator/screensaver thingy by Shamus Young.

Not sure if anyone before me have forked it, but since Google code is going down and I'm interested in keeping it for archive purposes I guess it's worth the 3-clicks procedure.
Runs like shit on my laptop, a bit of a shame since it has an i5-2500u and this is years old, the bloom especially kills it, probably fillrate-related.
